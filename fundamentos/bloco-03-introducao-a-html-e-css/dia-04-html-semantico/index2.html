           <p>
            Like us, mantis shrimps see colour with the help of light-sensitive proteins called opsins.<br>
            These form the basis of visual pigments that react to different wavelengths of light,<br>
            allowing us to see different colours.<br> 
            If a mantis shrimp has six UV receptors, it should have at least six opsins that are sensitive<br>
            to different flavours of UV.
            Except it doesn't. Bok could only find two.<br>
            To which: huh?
            How could there possibly be six types of photoreceptors with only two opsins?<br>
            There was one possibility.<br>
            Something could be filtering the light hitting the different receptors.
